## This is my first python project inthe ALX SE program.
It contains tasks which prints strings, integer number and also float number
Also It includes some operations which can be performed on string literals like concatination.
Concatinating string means adding the second string to the end of the first strigng.
In addition to this there is a task which splits a string and the choose whatever string we want and concatinating strings what we choose print that string without need of creating new string and literal
finally, This project comprises scripts to save, run and compile the file which is in python.
